11. I perform much better with the use of my mobile device, I expect you to trust me not to abuse such allowances. As an employee I would hope you place some trust in me, therefore I ask that you trust I would not abuse such permissions, I wish only to perform well at my job, and I feel from past experience that disallowing the use of a mobile device negatively, rather than positively impacts my performance.
12. If you feel uncomfortable with me using a personal device, you may provide a suitable work device instead.

15. Such a work device or the air time or the physical repairs should not incur extra cost to me, I am making an extra allowance on your behalf.
